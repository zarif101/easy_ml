# Easy ML

I know, I know, not a very creative name. New one coming soon - I promise!

So this is a web app/website which you can use to apply basic machine learning algorithms such as SVMs and regression, to your data. It is not 100% finished yet, so bear with me here. I probably shouldn't be putting my email on the internet, but if you have any questions or suggestions please email be at zarif.azher@gmail.com.

Also, I acknowledge that there is not documentation or information on how to use the platform. I guess it's up to you to figure it out :)
